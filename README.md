A self-hosted, DNS-aware, reverse-proxied **homelab** infrastructure project — built for learning, automation, and fun.

🔗 **Live demo**: [https://lab.noob-assist.fr](https://lab.noob-assist.fr)

## 🧪 Project Overview

This project sets up a full internal network and static site deployment pipeline using open-source tools, running on minimal hardware with Proxmox.

### 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools

- **OPNsense** on a Mini PC
- **Proxmox VE** turned my old computer into a bare metal
- **LXC containers**:
  - `Bind9` DNS server with forward/reverse zones
  - `Apache2` serving a **Jekyll** static site
  - `Nginx Proxy Manager` for HTTPS reverse proxy
- **Dynamic DNS updates** between OPNsense & Bind9
- **Let's Encrypt** SSL (via NPM)
- **VS Code Remote SSH** for editing the site

## 🗃️ Folders (Not included in repo)

This GitHub repo doesn't contain the full infrastructure (e.g., LXC containers, DNS zones), but it links to the live result and explains the steps.
I made an exercice available on the website to reproduce what I did.
